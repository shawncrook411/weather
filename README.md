# Weather App


## Description
This is a webpage that allows you to see the current weather data and the 5-day forecast of any city that you input. 

The cities that you search are put into tabs on the lefthand side so that you can easily reference them later. Your search history is persistant upon reload by saving into localStorage as well.

Currently the information that it displays is:
-Temperature
-Windspeed
-Humidity
-And an icon of the current weather
